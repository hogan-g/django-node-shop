        <h3>Welcome everyone to Spoingus' Emporium</h3>
        <p>We first shall begin with a word from our sponsor:</p>
        <i style="justify-content: left;">
            According to all known laws
            of aviation,
            <br>
            there is no way a bee
            should be able to fly.
            <br>
            Its wings are too small to get
            its fat little body off the ground.
            <br>
            The bee, of course, flies anyway
            <br>
            because bees don't care
            what humans think is impossible.
